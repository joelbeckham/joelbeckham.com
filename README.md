# joelbeckham.com

This is the source for my personal blog found at www.joelbeckham.com. It's a static site generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
It's deployed automatically via Travis CI at https://travis-ci.org/joelbeckham/joelbeckham.com and deployed to an S3 bucket with Static Site Hosting turned on. A CloudFront distribution sits in front of it to speed it up.
