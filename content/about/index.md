Hi, my name is Joel Beckham. I am a Web Developer, and am currently on a mission to automate our entire build and deployment pipeline. I&#8217;ve made a lot of progress: our website, data processing services, and database are automatically built and deployed. That foundation has lead the way to running unit, integration, and functional tests on every change we make. It&#8217;s amazing how much brain power you get back when you don&#8217;t have to worry about how you&#8217;re going to get the latest feature on to the live web server. It just happens now. It&#8217;s like magic.

I love learning and sharing what I&#8217;ve just learned. I&#8217;m not afraid of change. I grow a lot from my mistakes and value thoughtful constructive criticism.

My wife and son are some of the coolest people I know. We enjoy hiking in the mountains more than most anything else.
