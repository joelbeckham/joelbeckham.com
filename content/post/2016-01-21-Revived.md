It's been almost exactly 2 years since my last post, and I'm excited to start writing again. My blog was on Wordpress previously, and part of me was dreading getting back into that for such a simple site. So, I decided it was time to try something different: I settled on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator, and so far have been extremely pleased. I'll write more about that transition in a bit.
