> &quot;One of the hardest parts of working with domain logic seems to be that people often find it difficult to recognize what is domain logic and what is other forms of logic. An informal test I like is to imagine adding a radically different layer to an application, such as a command-line interface to a Web Application. If there's any functionality you have to duplicate in order to do this, that's a sign of where domain logic has leaked into the presentation. Similarly, do you have to duplicate logic to replace a relational database with an XML file?&quot;
