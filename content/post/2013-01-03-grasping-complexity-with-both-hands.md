I really enjoyed this talk, [Grasping Complexity with Both Hands][1] ([outline][2]), by Glenn Vanderburg. Here are a couple of his ideas that I found really thought-provoking:

New idea doesn&#8217;t have to be perfect to be good. Don&#8217;t dismiss them as soon as you find a single flaw.

How to make decisions in the face of truly complex problems:

  * <span style="line-height: 13px;" data-mce-mark="1">Don&#8217;t think in terms of right and wrong solutions. Think in terms of costs, benefits, and risks.</span>
  * Don&#8217;t expect a perfect and complete answer. Try to find 80/20 solutions.
  * Don&#8217;t expect to find a perfect, simple solution that covers all edge cases and all possible things that can go wrong. Ways to tackle this: 
      * Solve the common case optimally, and accept sub-optimal solutions for the edge cases.
      * Don&#8217;t try to predict everything that will go wrong and prevent it. Instead create good feedback loops so that you can respond when something actually does go wrong.
